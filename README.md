"Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics"
This study aims to analyze differences in the proteomics of rats induced to alcohol consumption. Through detailed statistical analysis of the proteins expressed in the hypothalamus of these rats, we seek to identify candidates with significant variations that may be related to an altered state caused by alcohol consumption. This approach will allow for a deeper understanding of how alcohol affects organism biology at the proteomic and phosphoproteomic levels.

To use this project, ensure that you have the following libraries installed in your R environment. You can install them by executing the following code in your R console:



install.packages(c("effsize", "readxl", "data.table", "readr", "stats", "formattable", 
                   "dplyr", "car", "xlsx", "openxlsx", "tm", "tidytext", "tidyverse", 
                   "edgeR", "gplots", "igraph", "ggraph", "ggplot2", "ggrepel", "pheatmap"))


The starting data consists of an XLSX file providing detailed information about detected proteins, including normalized, scaled, or raw abundance values, as well as information and descriptions of GO terms, among other details.
